/*Develop a mini project that will:
a) Display a list of numbers to the screen (random numbers).
b) Pick one of those numbers at random and start a guessing game
c) The user must guess the selected number. You must validate that the
number the user guessed was valid, and among the choices listed.
d) Tell the user whether or not the number they guessed is larger or smaller than the number youâ€™re looking for.
e) After a certain number of guesses, the user loses and gets prompted to try
again.*/
